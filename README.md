ModernHttpClient
================

This library brings the latest platform-specific networking libraries to Xamarin applications via a custom HttpClient handler. Write your app using System.Net.Http, but drop this library in and it will go drastically faster. This is made possible by two native libraries:

* On iOS, [AFNetworking 1.3.3](http://afnetworking.com/)
* On Android, via [OkHttp 1.2.1](http://square.github.io/okhttp/)

## Usage

The good news is, you don't have to know either of these two libraries above, using ModernHttpClient is the most boring thing in the world. Here's how it works:

On iOS:

```cs
var httpClient = new HttpClient(new AFNetworkHandler());
```

On Android:

```cs
var httpClient = new HttpClient(new OkHttpNetworkHandler());
```

## How can I use this in a PCL?

Using ModernHttpClient from a PCL is fairly easy with some rigging, especially if you've got some sort of IoC/DI setup - request an HttpClient in your PCL, and register it in your app. However, here's what you can do without any external dependencies:

```cs
// In your PCL
public static class HttpClientFactory 
{
    public static Func<HttpClient> Get { get; set; }
    
    static HttpClientFactory()
    {
        Get = (() => new HttpClient());
    }
}

// Somewhere else in your PCL
var client = HttpClientFactory.Get();

// In your iOS app (i.e. the startup of your app)
public static class AppDelegate
{
    public void FinishedLaunching(UIApplication app, NSDictionary options)
    {
        HttpClientFactory.Get = (() => new HttpClient(new AFNetworkHandler()));
    }
}
```

## How can I use this in MvvmCross?
